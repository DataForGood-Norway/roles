# Roles

## Representative

People from outside who want
to get in touch will need to be
able to talk to one or two
specific people who can explain
them what we do etc. Especially, in
the long term, if things like
funding are involved, a
representative will certainly be
useful. For obvious reasons, a 
*native Norwegian speaker* would be 
a suitable choice.

communication is efficient in
the sense that
1. all important
subjects/problems are discussed
2. a solution is found and if needed

implement/do stuff

### Reponsibilities
