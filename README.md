# "Roles"

We have defined a few "roles" that are supposed to solve a few common tasks, thereby empowering our community to focus on actual development work and problem solving. If you feel, that something is missing, create an issue within this repo or post in our [#organization channel in Slack](https://data4good-no.slack.com/messages/C9MUKBM7D)

## Project "Leads"

Each project we do needs a scrum-style go-to-person. It is what, e.g., Data for Democracy are doing.
This role changes from project to project and will be at the core
of DfG.

### Responsibilities

 - keep the group on track
 - take questions
 - help new folks joining a project get settled in 


## Representative(s)

People from outside who want
to get in touch will need to be
able to talk to one or two
specific people who can explain
them what we do etc. Especially, in
the long term, if things like
funding are involved, a
representative will certainly be
useful. For obvious reasons, *native Norwegian speakers* would be a suitable choice.

### Reponsibilities
- being the contact person for
people/organizations who
want to get in touch with DfG
- advertise what we do face-to-face
-...

Contact @Kleng_Br√•tveit in Slack if you want to contribute as ambassador for DataForGood.


## Moderator(s) 

In meetings, it is important that
communication is efficient in
the sense that
1. all important
subjects/problems are discussed
2. a solution is found and if needed
3. someone (or a group of
people) is determined to
implement/do stuff

### Reponsibilities

- organize time and location of
meetings
- collect information on
problems and issues that need
to be discussed in the next
meeting
- moderate in the way described above
- take minutes so that people
who were not at the meeting
are still up to date with regards
to important things

## Homepage/Social Media People

Ensure that we have a coherent and up to
date online representation of
what we do and what is going
on.

### Responsibilities

- work on homepage
- take care of social media accounts
- incorporate content projects
create (maybe this could also
be delegated to the people who
mainly work on these projects)
- ...
